This project is a simple React application with Redux for state management, Axios for API requests, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The key components include:

Frontend: React components for user authentication and profile management.
State Management: Redux is used to manage authentication and user profile state.
API Integration: Axios is used to communicate with backend endpoints for user login and profile management.
Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for responsive design.
Key Components
1. Redux State Management
authSlice: Handles authentication state, including token and user data.
2. API Integration
loginUser: Handles user login and token retrieval.
fetchUserProfile: Retrieves user profile information.
3. React Components
LoginPage: Handles user login.
UserProfile: Displays and allows editing of user profile information.

Sample Code Snippets
User Authentication
authSlice.js

js
Copy code
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'auth',
  initialState: {
    token: null,
    user: null,
  },
  reducers: {
    setToken: (state, action) => {
      state.token = action.payload;
    },
    setUser: (state, action) => {
      state.user = action.payload;
    },
    logout: (state) => {
      state.user = null;
      state.token = null;
    }
  }
});

export const { setToken, setUser, logout } = authSlice.actions;
export default authSlice.reducer;
API Calls Using Axios
api.js

js
Copy code
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL,
});

export const loginUser = async (credentials) => {
  const response = await api.post('/auth/login', credentials);
  return response.data;
};

export const fetchUserProfile = async (token) => {
  const response = await api.get('/user/profile', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
  });
  return response.data;
};
